## Overview

### What is QuickStatements?

QuickStatements is a web-based tool designed primarily for users of Wikidata, a free and open knowledge base that allows users to create and edit structured data. The tool is especially useful for batch editing, which enables users to make multiple changes or add numerous items quickly, rather than manually editing each entry one at a time. 

The **QuickStatements 3.0** homepage offers users a streamlined interface to manage and track batch edits efficiently. This documentation outlines each feature available on the homepage, what they do, and how users can interact with them to make their editing workflow smoother.

## Features Description and Usage

1. **Navigation Menu**:  
   Located at the top of the page, the navigation menu includes:
   - **QuickStatements 3.0**: A clickable title that redirects users back to the homepage from any other page within the application.
   - **New Batch**: Allows users to create a new batch of edits to Wikidata. This feature is ideal for those looking to start fresh with a new series of edits.
   - **Last Batches**: Provides a history of recently created batches, allowing users to view and manage recent edits quickly.
   - **Git**: Links to the Git repository of the QuickStatements project, where users can explore the source code, contribute to development, or review any changes made to the project.

2. **Login or User Information**:
   `Login: [Top Right Corner]` The clickable login link allows users to log into their Wikimedia accounts.

   - The username of the logged-in user is displayed on the top-right corner when a user is logged-in, indicating the active user session.
   - Next to the username is a link labelled **Your last batches**, which when clicked, shows the user a list of their most recent batch edits. This is particularly useful for keeping track of personal contributions.

3. **New Batch Button**:  
   Below the welcome message, a prominent green button labelled **New Batch** allows users to start the process of creating a new batch of edits. When clicked, this directs users to the batch creation page where they can specify the details of their edits.

4. **Batch Lookup Section**:
   - This section is designed for users to **search for specific batches** or retrieve **batches based on usernames**. There are two input fields:
   
     - **Batch ID**:  
       - Function: Users can enter the unique identifier (Batch ID) for a specific batch of edits. This allows them to locate and view the details of that batch.
       - Action Button: **See batch details**. Clicking this button will retrieve the batch associated with the entered Batch ID and display the details.
